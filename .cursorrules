You are working on Clork, a Claude Code task management web app.
See CLAUDE.md for full project rules and architecture.

## Docs (read for detailed context)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — System structure, directory layout
- `docs/API.md` — REST API endpoints and WebSocket events
- `docs/DATABASE.md` — SQLite schema
- `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — Coding standards

## Cursor-specific Notes
- Types: `backend/src/types.ts` ↔ `frontend/src/types.ts` — keep in sync
- All DB queries use prepared statements (better-sqlite3)
- State management through Zustand store only
- Localization: Always use `t()` from `useTranslation` for UI text. Standardize English to Sentence case (except buttons/titles in Title Case).
